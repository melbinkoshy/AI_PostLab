1. Explain the Time Complexity of the A* Algorithm.
The time complexity of A* depends on the quality of the heuristic function. In a
worst-case, the algorithm can be O(b^d), where b is the branching factor – the average
number of edges from each node, and d is the number of nodes on the resulting path.




2. What are the limitations of A* Algorithm?
The A* algorithm, while renowned for its efficiency, has certain limitations to consider:
    1. Computational Cost:
    A* can be computationally expensive, especially in scenarios with:
    Extensive search spaces: When dealing with a vast number of possible paths, the
    exploration process can become resource-intensive.
    High branching factors: If each node in the search space has many potential
    neighbors, the algorithm needs to evaluate numerous options, increasing computation time.

    2. Reliance on Heuristics:
    A* heavily relies on the quality of the heuristic function used to estimate the distance
    to the goal.
    Poor heuristic: A poorly designed heuristic can lead the algorithm down suboptimal
    paths, potentially missing the truly optimal solution.
    Domain-specific: Designing an effective heuristic often requires significant domain
    knowledge, making it less versatile for problems with diverse characteristics.

    3. Limited Applicability:
    A* may struggle with specific types of search spaces:
    Dynamic environments: A* assumes a static environment where the cost of moving
    between nodes remains constant. This can be problematic in real-world scenarios with
    dynamic elements.
    Uninformed search spaces: If there is no information available to guide the search
    (i.e., no heuristic function), A* loses its efficiency advantage and might not be the most
    suitable choice.




3. Discuss A*, BFS, DFS and Dijkstra’s algorithm in detail with examples.
    Breadth-First Search (BFS):
    BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
    It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node), explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present
    depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
    BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the next nodes to visit.
    BFS guarantees the shortest path in terms of number of edges from the start node to every
    other node.
    Example:
    Let's say we have a graph represented as follows:
      A
    / | \
    B C D
    / \ / \
    E F G H
    If we perform BFS starting from node A, the traversal order would be: A -> B -> C -> D -> E
    -> F -> G -> H.

    Depth-First Search (DFS):
    DFS is another algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
    It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node), explores as far as possible along each branch
    before backtracking.
    DFS uses a stack data structure (or recursion) to keep track of the next nodes to visit.
    DFS does not guarantee the shortest path; it might traverse deep into a branch before
    considering other branches.
    Example:
    Using the same graph as above, if we perform DFS starting from node A, the traversal order
    might be: A -> B -> E -> F -> C -> D -> G -> H.

    Dijkstra's Algorithm:
    Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other
    vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
    It maintains a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source vertex is already
    known.
    It iteratively selects the vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source vertex and
    updates the distances to its adjacent vertices if a shorter path is found.
    Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented using a priority queue.
    Example:
    Consider the following graph with weighted edges:
      A
    / | \
    B C D
    / \ / \
    E F G H
    If we apply Dijkstra's algorithm with source node A, it would compute the shortest paths to all
    other nodes in the graph.

    A Algorithm:*
    A* (pronounced "A star") is a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph
    between a given start node and a target node.
    It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal, combined with the
    actual cost of reaching that node from the start.
    A* keeps track of the total estimated cost of reaching a node, called the "f-score," which is
    the sum of the cost from the start to the current node (g-score) and the heuristic estimate
    from the current node to the goal (h-score).
    It prioritizes exploring nodes with lower f-scores, thus guiding the search towards the goal
    more efficiently.
    Example:
    Suppose we have a grid-based map where each cell represents a node in the graph, and we
    want to find the shortest path from the start cell to the target cell. A* algorithm can be
    applied, where the heuristic function might be the Euclidean distance between the current
    cell and the target cell.
